# A Night At The Movies
Keeping track of all the parts of our digital lives is a pain. Now that I know how to write Ruby, however, I can make things easy for myself! by creating a program that will keep track of our movie ratings.

### It‚Äôll do one of four things: 
> add a new movie to a library, 
> update the rating for an existing movie, 
> display the movies and ratings that are already in the hash, or delete a movie from the hash. If it doesn‚Äôt receive one of those four commands, the program will output some kind of error message.

## Objectives
- To gain more expertise and more comfortable writing ruby code 
- To exploit other room for creativity when handling ruby project
- To cement and enforce the lesson learn while learning ruby.

## Built With
- Ruby
- Use rubocop to correct linters errors
- Github-worflow
